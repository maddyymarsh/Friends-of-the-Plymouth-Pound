                <p>Friends of the Plymouth Pound (FPP), is a non-profit animal welfare organization dedicated to creating 
                    "forever homes" for rescued cats and dogs on the South Shore. Founded in 1984, 
                    The Friends and its dedicated and caring volunteers have assisted thousands of animals (owned and strays)
                     by providing support through the groups various programs, which include: low-cost spay/neutering, adoption, and educational outreach.
                     <br><br>
                     
                    In addition, FPP also has an active foster care program for displaced dogs and cats.
                     These volunteer "foster homes" provide loving "transition" homes for animals while they await adoption.
                    Friends of the Plymouth Pound does not receive any state or local funding to maintain 
                    or operate any of its programs. The group relies
                     solely on the generosity of donations from the general public.
