        <div class="adoptGridContainer">
            <div class="adoptGridColLeft">
                <p>Thank you for considering to adopt your new dog or cat from our organization. Please read this section carefully, as it explains our adoption policies and procedures in detail. 
                    It is intended to assist you in selecting an animal that is suitable for you, your family and your lifestyle. Friends of the Plymouth Pound have established guidelines and
                     set standards to ensure that the animals in our adoption program are placed into their "Forever Homes." 
                    <br> <br>
                    The first step in the process it to complete an adoption application. This can be done in 2 ways: online, by clicking here for the Cat Adoption Form, or here for the Dog Adoption Form,
                     or in person at our adoption center located at the Kingston Mall. Applications are processed in the order in which they are received. You must be at least 21 years of age to adopt
                      an animal from our organization. If visiting our cat adoption center with young children, please do not lead them to believe they will be leaving with a pet, as our adoption process
                       can take up to 14 days to complete. 
                    <br> <br>
                    All applicable information on the application MUST be completed. Incomplete or missing information may cause a delay in processing or non-approval of an application. Please note that
                     as part of our review process, ALL references will be contacted. In some instances, a pre-adoption home visit may also be conducted. If you currently own a pet/s, they must be up to 
                     date with all appropriate vaccinations before FPP will consider placing an animal in your home. You should contact your vet's office to inform them that you may be adopting a new pet 
                     and that Friends of the Plymouth Pound will be calling for a vet reference. Many vets will not disclose personal medical information about their clients without your consent.
                    <br> <br>
                    Once your application has been reviewed, you will be contacted by an FPP Representative to schedule a meet and greet with the animal you are interested in adopting if you are approved. 
                    We are an all volunteer organization, and it will take some time for us to process your application.  Friends of the Plymouth Pound does not adopt any animal from their adoption program 
                    to out of state adopters. Please note that we do not adopt to families with children under the age of 7 years of age due to liability reasons.
                    <br><br>
                    Cats and dogs for adoption can be viewed on our website here. Cats can also be seen by viewing them safely from our display windows at our adoption center location during open hours.

                    All animals adopted by FPP have been examined by a licensed veterinarian, received all age appropriate vaccinations, spayed or neutered, tested for heartworm (dogs) or combo tested for feline aid/leukemia 
                    (cats), given monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives, and have been micro-chipped. </p>
