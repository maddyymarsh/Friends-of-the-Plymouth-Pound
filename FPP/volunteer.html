                <p>Choosing to volunteer with Friends of the Plymouth Pound can
                     be a very rewarding experience. Our mission is simple... To reduce the 
                     overpopulation of homeless animals throughout the South Shore by "creating forever" 
                     homes for the adoptable animals in our program.
                    <br> <br>
                    Sounds simple right? Not as easy as you may think. There are many things that happen behind 
                    the scenes in order to make that perfect match for both adopter and the animal being adopted.
                    <br><br>
                    This is where our volunteers come in. The role of an FPP volunteer is a very important one. 
                    Our main goal is to provide a clean, safe, healthy and happy environment for all the animals in care. 
                    Without the dedication and commitment of our volunteers, we would not be able to help the many deserving
                     animals in our community as we do.  
                    <br><br>
                    All volunteers are required to complete a volunteer application, and sign a Liability Waiver Form. Training is 
                    provided to all volunteers prior to being allowed to work at the adoption center. 
                    <br><br>
                    You must be at least 21 years of age to volunteer (for liability reasons), have the ability to follow directions,
                     be able to bend, stand/stoop during your 2-3 hour shift; animal care experience is a plus, but not required. you should 
                     have compassion and empathy and be able to provide unconditional love to the animals in our adoption program.
                    <br><br>
                     FPP is looking for volunteers to help out at the Cat Adoption Center located at the Kingston Collection Mall in Kingston.
